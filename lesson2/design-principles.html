      <p>This law says that as the web page has more options to choose from, the user takes more time to make a
        decision. People usually avoid being overwhelmed with a lot of information. With fewer options, the user more
        quickly takes the decision. On this web page of BBC English learning, there are thousands of videos to learn
        English, but the main page of English learning shows in the header the most recent chapter of all the videos.
        The header is a big image with images or text that call attention. while scrolling down in this web, we can find
        others sections ordered in a horizontal way.

        Despite the huge quantity of information that this web has, the information is organized in a way that at first
        glance we have a few options to choose from.

      <p>This law of design is very important because it is related to the amount of time taken to move to one target,
        especially on graphical interaction . This law have mathematical calculations, but it is really simple, as more
        size the element to interact less time to take action by the user, as more small is the element like a button,
        more time to give click in there. The web page of Uxcel, I think that is a good example of this law, because the
        button is big enough to invite the user to push in. But I think that the success of this web is a conjunction of
        several elements like the spacing, colors, contrast, alignment and so on.</p>

      <h3>PARC: Alignment</h3>

          alt="This is a screenshot of one page with great alignment design principle">
      </picture>
      <p>This law refers to lining up the elements in the web page, the elements could be images, text, tables. One web
        page with poor alignment could be looked at as unfinished; one web page with a well alignment is very easy to
        read. I think that the most we have looked at the menu of Word, there are options to align the text, so that
        there are some types of alignment; it could be to the left, right, center, justified, but the elements could be
        aligned in horizontal, vertical way also. Ladowntowner is a magazine web pages and at the top, we can see many
        seasons aligned horizontally. Then downward we can see articles aligned in horizontal and vertical ways, I think
        that it is a combination of alignments.
